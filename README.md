 CALIBRATION AND ANALYSIS  OF INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER
Biopotential amplifiers must operate in that portion of the frequency spectrum in which the biopotentials that they amplify exist. Because of the low level of such signals, it is important to limit the bandwidth of the amplifier so that it is just great enough to process the signal adequately. In this way, we can obtain optimal signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Biopotential signals usually have amplitudes of the order of a few millivolts or less. Such signals must be amplified to levels compatible with recording and display devices. This means that most biopotential amplifiers must have high gains-of the order of 1000 or greater.


Procedure
1.	To apply input signal from various sources to the biosignal amplifier and observe the output of biosignal amplifier.
2.	To change the gain of Amplifier and observe the change in output signal.
3.	To record the output of biosignal amplifier with different gains and different inputs.
4.	Plot the characteristic of biosignal amplifier.
5.	To compare the output of simulated biosignal amplifier with the theoritical value
